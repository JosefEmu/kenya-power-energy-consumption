# Kenya Power | Energy Usage Tool

This tool can be used to track the overall energy consumption for a given time interval.

### Using the program on Terminal/Powershell 
*Ensure you have Python 3 installed*
- Navigate to folder location using terminal
- Launch python

```sh
$ cd kplc
$ python
```
- Import the module preferably as kplc, or any other keyword convenient to you
  

- Create a new instance of the EnergyUsage class and provide the initial meter 
reading and date as follows:

```python
import Kenya_Power_Energy_Usage as kplc
dec= kplc.EnergyUsage(0,"20181201")
```

### Adding tokens
- Use the created instance and add_tokens method to add units bought including their price

```python
dec.add_tokens(6.6, 100)
dec.add_tokens(21, 300)
```

### Getting the average daily usage
- Use the monthly_usage to get the average daily consumption

```python
dec.monthly_usage("20181230",1)
```

### Voila!
